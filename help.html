            <h3>What is Join?</h3>
            <span><a href="./index.html">Join</a> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
                group of dedicated students as
                part of their web development bootcamp at the <a href="https://www.developerakademie.com">Developer
                    Akademie GmbH</a>.
                <br><br>
                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <a href="./index.html">Join</a> leverages the
                principles of kanban to help
                users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
                <br><br>
                It is important to note that <a href="./index.html">Join</a> is designed as an educational exercise and
                is not intended for
                extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot

        <h3 class="rm-mb">How to use it</h3>
        <div class="help-text">
            <span>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <a href="./index.html">Join</a>:</span>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Exploring the Board</h4>
                    <span>When you log in to <a href="./index.html">Join</a>, you'll find a default board. This board
                        represents your project and
                        contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Creating Contacts</h4>
                    <span>In <a href="./index.html">Join</a>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go
                        to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once
                        added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the
                        board.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Adding Cards</h4>
                    <span>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
                        tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task
                        details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Moving Cards</h4>
                    <span>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                        dropping the card from one list to another.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Deleting Cards</h4>
                    <span>
                        Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a
                        card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as
                        this action is irreversible.
                        <br><br>
                        Remember that using <a href="./index.html">Join</a> effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to
                        ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.
